 1. [ ] What happened when you ran bug3? Use ls -ot, see if there are any new files in your directory.
 2. [ ] In which function did it bomb?
 3. [ ] Okay, now, use GDB to debug these other programs. For each, below, record what the problem was, and how you fixed it.
     a. bug1.c
     b. bug2.c
     c. bug3.c
     d. avg.c
     e. Calc.c
     f. quickSortBug.c/driverBug.cc
     g. sort2.c
 4. [ ] Why can't the compiler catch this? You can uncover the problem by looking at a stack trace from when the program crashed (see the lab on how to do this).
 5. [ ] What happens if you are using qsort to sort integers and accidently pass the string comparison function?
